# updateRPackages
R Script to do a brew update, move packages to current .libPath(), and finally update all R packages.

Just starting out using Homebrew. I've also always thought it would be nice to set up an automatic R package update. So, here is a quick start. Suggestions welcome!

Cheers!
John
