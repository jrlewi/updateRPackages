# updateRPackages
R Script to do a brew update and then update all R packages

Just starting using Homebrew. I've also always thought it would be nice to set up and automatic R package update. So, here is a start. Will eventually work with cronR to make a scheduled update job.

Enjoy or contribute.

Cheers!
John
